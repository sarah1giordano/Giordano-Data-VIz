# The final data story
My final story on Pittsburgh's developing housing crisis can be found here: [https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/pittsburghs-emerging-housing-crisis/index.html] (https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/pittsburghs-emerging-housing-crisis/index.html)

# Changes made since Part II

In part II, I identified the following changes to make in Part III:

1) Incorporating even more of the “face of the story”, quotes and callout text from people who have been displaced and research on where those residents are moving. In general, I think this is my biggest takeaway.

2) Including a little more focus on the present day - where are residents now? What neighborhoods are rapidly changing? What are people doing in response? - will help ground the call to action section more.

3) Focus my visuals in the set up section on the most comparable cities - 2/3 interviewees agreed that the Rust Belt comparison was far more helpful than the major cities comparison, and I’m inclined to agree with them. I may end up tweaking this to include another bar with the national average as a reference point as well, since there was an interest in more reference points.

4) Tweak my line graph of visual #3 to give a comparison to the national average. I haven’t dug into whether Pittsburgh’s rate of increase is similar to the national average or not, and I should do some of that analysis to either include an appropriate reference line or to provide appropriate context narratively for the visual. If it has been increasing more than the national average, that would certainly be interesting to show.

5) I may break visual #4 into side-by-side line charts instead of including both these lines on the same visual. While I want the analysis to be paired together, this did confuse 2/3 interviewees, and I can understand why.

6) I think I’m going to jettison visual #5 - while only one interviewee brought up issues with this visual, and it was the favorite for another visual, I was already having doubts about it. I think this could probably be better communicated as a callout statistic like “The median rent in Pittsburgh is 80% of what low-income residents earn monthly”.


    A few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II.  Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).   Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story. 
 


## The audience

I ended up targeting my final data story towards an audience similar to the audience I would have for my final presentation - new Pittsburgh residents. In an effort to develop call to action prompts that were as specific as possible, I further narrowed this to Heinz students (and included a call to action to join a student coalition for fair housing). 

As I discussed this project with my community, I found that many of the long-term Pittsburgh residents already knew about the issue and about the history of displacement and gentrification in Pittsburgh - but those who were newer to the city (like myself) had not yet learned about its history. These were also the people who tended to react similar to my friends, family, and myself when I first moved to Pittsburgh (saying things like, "Pittsburgh is so much cheaper than where I was before!" or "it's actually affordable here!") I thought that the final data story could be particularly useful for these newer residents. As such, I ended up adjusting my final project with a new resident in mind. That meant I included references to specific neighborhoods, which even new residents learn pretty quickly, but included a lot more history and context around the visuals. In my opinion, one of the best pieces of feedback I got during Part II of the project was to incorporate more of the human side of the story. I did a lot more research to find specific stories and quotes in an attempt to incorporate this, particularly because I felt like that would help this audience connect more quickly with the issue. 


## References
All my sources are captured at the end of my Shorthand presentation, and also included below for reference. I'd like to call particular attention to reference number 19 and 25, which are the data sources that I used to create my visualizations in Tableau. I also visualized data points/information included in reference numbers 3 and 6, although this didn't include working with a raw dataset.
