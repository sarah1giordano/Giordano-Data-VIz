# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II

In the table below, I note the changes I identified in Part II and what I ended up changing in Part III.

| Change Identified in Part II  | Action Taken in Part III |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1) Incorporating even more of the “face of the story”, quotes and callout text from people who have been displaced and research on where those residents are moving.| I noted in Part II that this was my biggest takeaway, and this was in fact the biggest change I made for Part III! In between my visualizations, I spent a lot more time with callout quotes (and even callout data) to try to connect this issue to the Pittsburgh resident's experiencing the most change. I didn't end up diving into research on where residents were moving - my data story was already fairly long, and I wanted to stay focused. I think another complete data story could be told about where resident's that are displaced are moving to, and there's Census data to dig into that might help us understand that more in the future. |
| 2) Including a little more focus on the present day - where are residents now? What neighborhoods are rapidly changing? What are people doing in response? - will help ground the call to action section more. | I found this paired really well with the first change I made, to incorporate more of a human face. I tried to pull quotes from residents post-displacement and about the rising costs generally and incorporate them, as well as include specific references to different Pittsburgh neighborhoods and community groups. To ground the call to action even further, I tried to make sure there was a very tangible action item for each call and to include links to help people take those steps. For example, instead of saying "call your local rep and tell them housing is a priority," I opted to include a link to find your district, a link to find your council member, and then a prompt to call them. |
| 3) Focus my visuals in the set up section on the most comparable cities - 2/3 interviewees agreed that the Rust Belt comparison was far more helpful than the major cities comparison, and I’m inclined to agree with them. I may end up tweaking this to include another bar with the national average as a reference point as well, since there was an interest in more reference points. | I did end up making the first change - both in which visual I included (the Rust Belt visual, not the major city visual) but also in the text itself. While drafting, I ended up dropping basically all references to other cities. I found that it cluttered the message too much, and once you bring up a different city, it becomes really easy to lose focus as a reader and instead start thinking about the myriad of ways those cities are different from each other. I did not end up tweaking this visual to include a bar with the national average in the end. I tested out including this, but found it was distracting. I ultimately decided that the whole point was to focus on comparable cities within this visual, and I made changes to the story text instead to provide more national context where I could. |
| 4) Tweak my line graph of visual #3 to give a comparison to the national average. I haven’t dug into whether Pittsburgh’s rate of increase is similar to the national average or not, and I should do some of that analysis to either include an appropriate reference line or to provide appropriate context narratively for the visual. If it has been increasing more than the national average, that would certainly be interesting to show. | I did dig into this to confirm for the final data story, and found that Pittsburgh's rate of increase in the Census data is very similar to the national average! I opted not to include this directly in the visual because adding the reference line for the national average made me think that the visual would have the opposite takeaway as intended - I wanted readers to focus on how much Pittsburgh's rent is increasing, not on the fact that it is still below the national average. Instead of including this reference point on the visual, I tried to make it clear in the text that yes, Pittsburgh is still relatively more affordable! But prices are also increasing here, and I explicitly include in the text before this visual that this increase is similar to what we're seeing nationwide. |
| 5) I may break visual #4 into side-by-side line charts instead of including both these lines on the same visual. While I want the analysis to be paired together, this did confuse 2/3 interviewees, and I can understand why. | This was another idea I had in Part II that I ended up rejecting for the final data story. Side-by-side visuals was visually too much for me within the story. I can totally understand why this chart takes a little bit longer for people to digest, but the feedback I got from testers was also that I included the necessary labels and information for them to walk away with the details they needed if they spent more than a few seconds on it. If the story was focused only on public housing and had fewer visuals already, I think I would have broken this up into two separate line charts. As it stands now, though, I thought it was overwhelming to do so. But I also thought it was important to include a visual on public housing, so I opted for this in an attempt to balance. I'm interested to see how it works out. |
| 6) I think I’m going to jettison visual #5 - while only one interviewee brought up issues with this visual, and it was the favorite for another visual, I was already having doubts about it. I think this could probably be better communicated as a callout statistic like “The median rent in Pittsburgh is 80% of what low-income residents earn monthly”. | I did jettison this! Once I added in more quotes and context on Pittsburgh residents, too, I found that the visual really wasn't necessary. People can speak for themselves in a more meaningful way about how unaffordable rent is for them, in a way that these raw numbers likely never could anyways. |
| N/A | One other change I made, that I didn't initially identify in Part II, was adding more context and references around nationwide housing costs rising. As I actually drafted my story, I found that this was a missing link. I was assuming people knew how much housing prices had increased in the U.S. particularly in the last few years, but I think this is a faulty assumption to make (particularly as many Heinz students are coming from outside the U.S.). I ended up adding almost a "newspaper clippings" section to quickly introduce this idea with clear references, instead of just vaguely referring to rising prices. |
| N/A | The last major design decision that I made that I didn't consider as much in Part II was the color scheme for my final data story. The presentation is serious, but I didn't want it to be in just black and white. I knew I needed some color to work with to keep people engaged, and also because I wanted to highlight so many callout statistics and quotes. I ended up with a navy/orange/gray color palette because this felt serious and academic but still had plenty of contrast and attention-grabbing possibility (particularly for the orange). Initially, you'll notice that a lot of my quotes and headers are in the orange because this feels like the more "urgent, bad-things-are=happening" color. When I shift to the more positive section (what can we do next, call to action), I tried to shift more towards the blues as a more hopeful color to end on. |

## The audience

I ended up targeting my final data story towards an audience similar to the audience I would have for my final presentation - new Pittsburgh residents. In an effort to develop call to action prompts that were as specific as possible, I further narrowed this to Heinz students (and included a call to action to join a student coalition for fair housing). 

As I discussed this project with my community, I found that many of the long-term Pittsburgh residents already knew about the issue and about the history of displacement and gentrification in Pittsburgh - but those who were newer to the city (like myself) had not yet learned about its history. These were also the people who tended to react similar to my friends, family, and myself when I first moved to Pittsburgh (saying things like, "Pittsburgh is so much cheaper than where I was before!" or "it's actually affordable here!") I thought that the final data story could be particularly useful for these newer residents. As such, I ended up adjusting my final project with a new resident in mind. That meant I included references to specific neighborhoods, which even new residents learn pretty quickly, but included a lot more history and context around the visuals. In my opinion, one of the best pieces of feedback I got during Part II of the project was to incorporate more of the human side of the story. I did a lot more research to find specific stories and quotes in an attempt to incorporate this, particularly because I felt like that would help this audience connect more quickly with the issue.
