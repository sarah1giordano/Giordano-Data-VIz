# Assignment 2: Visualizing Government Debt
## Part one: Working with web-based visualization tools and data

_Include your visualization, and introduce us to what you did._
Below is an example visualization from OECD of government debt. OECD's data repository includes different indicators and interactive ways to view the data. These data were found by searching for "government debt," and choosing their general government debt dataset. I was able to choose specific years of data, and chose 2022; the column highlighted in blue is OECD's average country for comparison.

## Working with Tableau

The following visualization draws upon the same data from OECD on national debt to GDP ratio but visualizes it as a heat map instead, and shows how government debt has changed over time across countries. I created this visual using Tableau and following specific course instructions.

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1730429999806' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Japan&#39;s national debt is highest on averagecompared to national GDP over time ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Na&#47;NationalDebttoGDP&#47;NationalDebttoGDP&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='NationalDebttoGDP&#47;NationalDebttoGDP' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Na&#47;NationalDebttoGDP&#47;NationalDebttoGDP&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                
<script type='text/javascript'>                    
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1730429999806');                  
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                   
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);
</script>

## Part three: create your own visualization

_Create another data visualization using the same data used earlier. DO NOT submit something that's just a minor modification of one of the visualizations already covered here. So, don't just modify the colors or labels of one of the earlier examples and call it good, or submit a slightly modified bar chart.  Instead, see what you can come up with on your own, and spend some time to try and create something that tells a story about the data._

_Summarize in a paragraph or two about the different methods of visualization, and how they compare / contrast to one another. Make sure you include all source information and explain the data well.  Talk about why you chose the third data visualization.  Be specific - keep your writeup relevant to the assignment, and avoid jargon-filled language that doesn't say anything useful._

_It's a good idea to go back and review your work.  Could someone follow your process and understand what you did?  Do you need to further connect any of the sections with a bit of text?  Is it something you'd be happy to have as an example of your work from the class?_
