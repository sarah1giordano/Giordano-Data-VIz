# Assignment 2: Visualizing Government Debt
## Part one: Working with web-based visualization tools and data

Below is an example visualization from OECD of government debt. OECD's data repository includes different indicators and interactive ways to view the data. These data were found by searching for "government debt," and choosing their general government debt dataset. I was able to choose specific years of data, and chose 2022; the column highlighted in blue is OECD's average country for comparison.

## Part two: Guided work with Tableau and public use data

The following visualization draws upon the same data from OECD on national debt to GDP ratio but visualizes it as a heat map instead, and shows how government debt has changed over time across countries. I created this visual using Tableau and following specific course instructions.

## Part three: My own visualization using Tableau and the same public use dataset

I created the following visual using Tableau to help visualize the extent to which Japan's national debt to GDP ratio is an outlier, even among countries with high debt to GDP ratios. I played around with the data quite a bit before settling on this idea. While there are a number of stories I could have told -- different regional trends, countries that actually managed to decrease their national debt to GDP ratio, countries with huge changes in their ratios -- I found that this was one of the clearest to visualize. Japan's trendline always stands out across time. Japan also had high quality data in our dataset; by that, I mean OECD had data for Japan at nearly every time period of interest, so there weren't any clear gaps in the data. 

To showcase Japan's particularly high national debt to GDP ratio, I considered two main options: a bar chart or a line chart. The clearest way to visualize the gap between Japan and the next closest country (Greece) using a bar chart would have required me to select one point in time only (using multiple bars for different time points got busy very quickly). While I found this to be effective, when I tested out a line chart, I found it to be even more effective because it was able to still clearly convey that gap, but now showed that it has existed for ~20 years. While the bar chart lost almost all nuance in the data, the line chart was able to quickly convey the key idea (Japan is much higher than everyone else), while also including ideas such as:

  1) This is not recent, Japan has had the highest debt ratio since at least 2000 and crossed the 200% debt ratio in roughly 2010
    
  2) Japan has remained above the 200% threshold since then
    
  3) No country has even come close to joining them in crossing the 200% threshold until 2018
    
  4) If we expect Greece's ratio to increase at a roughly similar rate, they will join Japan in crossing this threshold and being one of the few high debt/GDP ratio countries to continue to increase that ratio, rather than decrease it or hold it steady

This visualization does, however, lose some nuance compared to the heat map from part 2. I first used the visualization from part 2 as a base and switched to a line chart, but including all the countries in the line chart was incredibly cluttered. To deal with this, I took the following steps:

1) I chose to work with a subset of the data, specifically the ten countries with the highest national debt to GDP ratio (on average, over time).
   
2) I removed any countries with missing data -- except for Japan, which is missing data from 2019 but is the focus of my chart -- from the dataset. My point was that Japan was far and away the highest debt to GDP ratio, and that Greece was getting close. None of the countries with missing data added any value to my chart - instead, what they did was distract from the main point, because there would be strange gaps in their lines or their lines would start later than other countries. For this reason, my top 10 countries looks a little different from the heat map's ranking of countries.
   
3) I changed the axes to reduce information while still being as clear as possible. For the y-axis, I reduced the number of tick marks to every 50. The point of the visual was the distance between Japan and everyone else, and that Japan had crossed the 200% line, which no one else had at that time. I found that the chart did not need more information on the y axis than that. For the x-axis, I first set an end date of 2018 instead of 2019, as 2018 is the last year when we have data for Japan. I then set a start date of 2000 rather than 1995. I found this set a clearer start - the turn of the century - and allowed me to do tick marks of every 2 years, which allowed the final timepoint (2018) to be clearly marked on the axis. Starting with 1995, I would have needed to include a tick for every year on the x axis if I wanted to label 2018 and still keep the distance between the ticks the same. In keeping with this change, I sorted the countries based on their average ratio (descending order) from 2000-2018 (excluding any data earlier than 2000). For reference, this slightly changed the order and who was included in the top 10.
   
4) I changed every line in the chart to be gray with the exception of Japan and Greece. I used red for Japan as a bright color to draw the eye and also an indicator of something potentially bad. I used orange for Greece as it is near red on the color wheel, and Greece is the next closest in debt to GDP ratio to Japan. I tested using a desaturated red/pink instead, but I found that this almost indicated that the lines were related or different values of a similar category. Greece and Japan are completely separate categories, so I wanted to make sure their colors were distinct enough from each other.


This decluttered the line chart a lot, but was too ambiguous. To help emphasize the message, I added labels for Japan and Greece with the most recent debt to GDP ratio in the dataset and used the color of their lines for these labels. I also added a label in gray for the rest of the lines to convey that these were other countries at a similar end of the debt to GDP spectrum. I chose to use one label for these lines rather than a separate label for each line because the point of the visual wasn't, for example, to be able to follow Austria's specific ratio over time; it was to compare Japan to others on the high end of the spectrum. My goal here was to provide context for the visual while not introducing too much clutter.

Finally, I added a reference line at 200% on the y axis. While the gap between Japan and the next closest countries was clear, I wanted to make it especially clear that Japan was in a league of its own and that no one had crossed the debt ratio that they had yet. 

Overall, I'm not sure that this line graph conveys the OECD data any better than the bar chart or heat map; it simply conveys a different story. The advantages of the line graph were being able to tell a clearer story of a particular country over time. The heat map we created has information overload if you wanted to just focus on Japan, and seeing a trendline, compared to slight changes in shade or color, was an easier way to see the degree of difference between Japan and others. The heat map, however, was able to capture a lot more information than the line graph. Using the heat map, I get a better understanding of changes in national debt to GDP ratio overtime overall, with the added benefit of the opportunity to explore the exact values for different countries if I wished to dig in further. The heat map more effectively tells the story of increasing national debt to GDP ratio within the dataset overtime than my line chart does, for example, and still tells me that Japan has a national debt to GDP ratio of 238.7 in 2018. The original bar chart from OECD does a good job of showing extremes, but only at a specific timepoint (and the version from OECD, at least, does not have all the labels necessary to interpret every bar). If the story I wanted to tell was focused on a specific year, a bar chart would have been a better pick.
