# Outline

> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project.
>
> The outline of your final project should serve as the building blocks for the rest of your presentation.  Your outline should be something that you can later use to help fill in some of the details around your project.  Outlinethe major elements of your story. (see Chapter 8 of Good Charts). Incorporate Story Arc and one sentence summary

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.  
Your sketches should mimic and follow aspects of your outline, and build on the resounding message you want to make clear through your project.  Build in elements of your anticipated story structure for your project.  Your sketches themselves do not have to be visually correct / accurate, but they should be detailed enough so that we can get some sense of what you're planning on doing. You may use whatever method makes the most sense to you (hand-drawn, digital, etc.).   Show both your anticipated data visualizations as well as major elements of your story itself (e.g key headers, etc.)

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data.
> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.

# Method and medium
> In a few sentences, you should document how you plan on completing your final project. 
 Will you use Shorthand and Tableau?  ArcGIS Story Maps, or something else?  You may also propose doing something else entirely (AR / VR, mixed media, data sonification, etc.).  If you choose to do something significantly outside of the technologies we've introduced in this course, please talk to me first.  To that end however, I want you to steer clear of using tools like MS Powerpoint and MS Excel for your final project.  Instead, your final project deliverable should be an interactive, stand-alone project that leverages some of the tools we've covered in the class (e.g. something you've created using Shorthand or another interactive platform, with data visualizations created in Tableau).  If you have something else in mind, talk to me first.
