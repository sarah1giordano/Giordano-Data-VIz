# About me
Sarah Giordano, she/her, current graduate student in Carnegie Mellon's Masters of Science in Public Policy and Management Program, Research Associate at Westat, and Fellow at the Block Center.

# What I hope to learn
A lot of policy research and program evaluation data visualizations can be pretty dense - the folks who create them love exploring their data, and want to share everything they can (myself included). I'm hoping to refocus my data visualization skills on visuals that are easily understandable, concise, and clearly communicate a message or key takeaway to the general public, even if they aren't familiar with the topic (or haven't read the rest of the article). I'm also hoping to get more creative with my visuals to help draw readers in, pique their interest, and keep longer reports more fun and interesting.

# Portfolio

##[Visualizing government debt] (visualizing-government-debt)
Practicing visualizations using web-based datasets and Tableau, and then developing my own original visualization of these data using Tableau.

## [Assignment 3&4: Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
Critiquing an exisiting data visualization, and then exploring the dataset and creating a new visualization using Tableau.

## Final project
Examining housing costs and public housing availability in Pittsburgh over time using Tableau and Shorthand. Final story can be found hosted on [Carnegie Mellon's Shorthand platform here] (https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/pittsburghs-emerging-housing-crisis/index.html)

I documented the process towards making this final project at the links below:
