# About me
Sarah Giordano, she/her, current graduate student in Carnegie Mellon's Masters of Science in Public Policy and Management Program, Research Associate at Westat, and Fellow at the Block Center.

# What I hope to learn
A lot of policy research and program evaluation data visualizations can be pretty dense - the folks who create them love exploring their data, and want to share everything they can (myself included). I'm hoping to refocus my data visualization skills on visuals that are easily understandable, concise, and clearly communicate a message or key takeaway to the general public, even if they aren't familiar with the topic (or haven't read the rest of the article). I'm also hoping to get more creative with my visuals to help draw readers in, pique their interest, and keep longer reports more fun and interesting.
